Blockchain core functions
- create wallet
- new blocks
- get all blocks
- get balance
- get wallet data +
- transfer +
- vault wallet
wallets should have types, vault wallets are wallets that can have cash limits on them from their creation
and so a users cannot spend more than a certain limit in a period of time



Broadcast functionality
- broadcast new wallet req +
- broadcast new transfer +


Node functionality
- Routing and discovery
- Add new node
- get blockchain data


New nodes will have to request for a list of wallets from the blockchain, new nodes will create these new wallets
and they will have a balance of 0. They will now listen for new transactions and record them.


DAu foundation will have a we platform that releases keys. These keys are needed to access the blockchain.
Users give us their mobile device IP address and we give them a key, we give this key to other nodes letting them know of the new key.
When a user wants to run a node, they will need that key and IP, their software will check in with other nodes.
10 keys will be produced every week. and can be increased.
DAU foundation is the only entity for now with the ability to produce these keys. Nodes will have a secrete hash and we will have a
key that can add new keys to the network.

#new idea
We do not need to sync new nodes with the rest of the network
new transactions can simply be processed on the new server, new server starts with zero data, when new transactions come,
it records it.
durring conscensus nodes without the wallet in question will not participate.


Syncing will only be about nodes ip addresses


License to mine
-----------------
Users need to pay to the dau foundation, 10dau and they will be granted license to mine, screening processes may be involved.
the dau foundation will then add the IP address to the network through a secrete code with a list of all the servers.

#
DAu foundation should be able to issue new tokens
DAu foundation should be able to add node to network
DAu foundation should be able to remove a node from the network
Nodes should not accept data from unknow nodes

DAU phases
- development
- community building
- love economy development - giving 60 million people 100 DAu each
- love forever!

//
node sync - new nodes should have all the wallets data
node discovery = new node should get all the other nodes ip addresses
issue new coins
